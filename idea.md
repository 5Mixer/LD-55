# Theme: Summoning

Grow plants based on either cellular automata or nodes.

Plants have various properties, but are more than just tuples, have definitive categories too.

Categories of plants/seeds are manually defined and part of the game's structure.

Goal is to grow specific types of seeds. Either as part of a shop mechanic, in which good seeds are valuable
and allow the acquisition of more precious seeds, or as part of an NPC system in which others trade and have
particular requests (i.e. can't just sell anything, specific items are requested).

Plants can be manipulated in various ways - grafting, cutting, watering, adding nutrients or other soil
additives.

Negative elements present a risk to your garden - funguses, weeds, pests, weeds?
